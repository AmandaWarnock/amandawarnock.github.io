#Examples of plotly

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
install.packages("plotly")
library(plotly)
library(p8105.datasets)
```

```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(rating = review_scores_location / 2) %>% 
  select(neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, rating, price,room_type, lat, long) %>% 
  filter(
    neighbourhood_group == "Manhattan", 
    price %in% 100:500,
    room_type == "Entire home/apt"
  ) %>% 
  drop_na(rating)
```

# Plotly plots

## scatterplot

```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>%
  mutate(text_label = str_c("Price: $", price, "\nRating: ", rating)) %>% 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~lat, y = ~long, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
    color = ~price, text = ~text_label, alpha = 0.5)
```

## boxplot

```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, price)) %>% 
  plot_ly(y = ~price, color = ~neighbourhood, type = "box", colors = "viridis")
```
^ they have both "box" and "violin"

## bar plot

```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>% 
  count(neighbourhood) %>% 
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, n)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~neighbourhood, y = ~n, color = ~neighbourhood, type = "bar", colors = "viridis")
```

# ggplotly

```{r}
scatter_ggplot = 
  nyc_airbnb %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lat, y = long, color = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.25) +
  coord_cartesian()

ggplotly(scatter_ggplot)
```
